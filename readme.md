============================


UfXtract is a fast and easy to use .Net microformats parser. With a few lines of code you can load and parse microformats from Urls or HTML strings. You can then extract the data directly in .Net or convert it into JSON, JSON-P or XML.

UfXtract currently supports the following microformats hCard, hCalendar, hReview, hResume, hAtom, XFN, rel-tag, geo, adr, rel-nofollow, rel-license, rel-directory, rel-home, rel-enclosure, rel-payment and votelinks.It also supports a handful of POSH patterns hCard-XFN, rel-me, rel-next/previous, test-suite and test-fixture. The support of rel-me and rel-next/previous was added to help people build social graph spiders.

UfXtract can typically parse a page between 10-50ms. I have gone to some pains to build a test suite to make sure it conforms as closely as possible to the microformats specs.

You can also easily create new microformats and POSH definitions using some simple .Net objects.
